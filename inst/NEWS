	o	The R Journal reference was updated (including the correct authors)
	
	o	The Pharmaceutical Statistics reference was updated
	
	o	A new option "auto" was included in the main function to automatically select the most appropriate method of the two available "GPQ" and "EL" methods

	o	Shapiro-Wilk's test p-values were fixed as NULL when the sample size falls outside of the interval [3,5000]

	o	The AUC result for the GPQ method is now given directly, not in a nested list

	o	The AUC result for the EL method is now given directly, not in a nested list

	o	The same column names ("Value", "ll" and "ul") as in the GPQ method were included in the EL method 

	o	The results of both methods EL and GPQ are now given under the list "Global"
	
	o	The possibility of using a group variable with categories different from 0 and 1 was included

	o	The type of the status variable to be used within gsym.point function was changed in the way that now the end-user is not forced to use the codification 0 and 1 for the status variable

	o	Some options of the plot function were changed in the way that the end-user can change the title and the labels of the axes given by default

	o	Output of the plot function was changed: 
	
			- The graphical display of the results includes the ROC-coordinates of the point estimates obtained
			- For datasets with ties now the accurate ROC curve is shown
			- The call to readline ("press return for next page") was avoided because it is problematic for non-interactive usage

	o	The unnecessary code in the calc.empirical.AUC function was deleted (the confidence level argument and the count.zeros and count.neg variables defined inside)

	o	Some unit tests were included using the testthat library in order to check that the correct ROC curves and AUC values are computed

	o	A new parameter "verbose" was included in the main function to turn on/off the option of printing information on the screen while the code is running
